Learn-Gregtech-1.7.10.
======================

**A pack centered around learning Gregtech in the 1.7.10. era!**

Like the previous pack, **Learn-Gregtech 1.7.10** is aimed at newer players trying to understand the mechanics and ways of the mod, but also for veterans trying to get a full understanding on concepts they might not have gotten before. The goal this time around is to provide a lightweight, quick modpack carefully crafted for an optimal pure-Gregtech excperience. The pack is designed to work seamlessly with other CQI packs, as a beginner level "tutorial" almost. The quests are easy, informative, and provide plenty of loot so the player can move on, and eventually finish quickly enough to move on to the full Gregtech pack (*TBA*). At CQI, we hope your experience is as enjoyable as possible and you learn a lot on the way.

Dig on fellas!
